# Fallout-4-Modding-Essentials

The Fallout 4 Modding Essentials Package aims to make modding Fallout 4 easier with a variety of different features to make modders lives easier.
 
This is done by automating many of the long and boring processes that modders have to go through when creating a mod. These include things like generating .lip files, converting audio files into other formats and debugging
your mods in general.
 
# Features of this package include:
 
- Generation of scripts that can be used through the Fallout 4 console to help you debug your mods
- A shortcuts menu that quickly gets you access to essential files needed when modding, or even just the Fallout 4 Directory itself
- Ability to generate .lip files automatically
- Ability to generate .fuz files from different source formats automatically
- Ability to generate original files that were packed into a .fuz file (splitting .fuz files)
- A Creation Kit debugging tool that searches though your Fallout 4 directory and looks for missing files
- Ability to quickly backup .esp, .esm, and .ba2 files. Filters through game files to ensure it only copies your mods
- Logging Support (to be expanded)

 # Advantages of using this package include:
- Quick and fast audio conversions
- Does all of the boring work for you
- Small File Size
- Room to be expanded on (I plan to expand on this package and bring more features to it over time)

Notice:

Please note that this package is still in Beta, therefore bugs are likely to arise. Please report bugs to me so I can patch them out!
